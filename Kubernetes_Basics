1. Kubernetes Basics
  What is Kubernetes?
      Kubernetes (K8s) is a container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
      
      Instead of running individual Docker containers manually, K8s manages clusters of containers and ensures the desired state is always maintained.

  Why Kubernetes?
      Automates scaling (adds/removes pods based on load)
    
      Self-healing (restarts failed pods)
    
      Load balancing (distributes traffic to healthy pods)
    
      Service discovery (automatic DNS for services)
      
      Declarative configuration (YAML files)

Architecture Components
      Control Plane (Master Node)
      API Server – central entry point (kubectl communicates here)
      
      etcd – key-value store for cluster state
      
      Scheduler – assigns pods to nodes based on resources
      
      Controller Manager – ensures desired state (e.g., keeps replicas running)

Worker Node Components
      Kubelet – runs on every node, manages pods
      
      Kube-proxy – manages networking rules (ClusterIP, NodePort)
      
      Container Runtime – runs containers (Docker, Containerd)

Real-Time Example
      Suppose you have 3 microservices: Frontend, Backend, Database.

Kubernetes ensures:

      Each service runs as pods
      
      If backend pod crashes, it restarts automatically
      
      Load balances traffic between multiple backend pods
